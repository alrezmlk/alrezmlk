## Project Overview

This repository provides a structured approach to the study and application of biomedical image analysis, combining practical tasks, theoretical studies, and research presentation skills. The coursework involves:
1. **Homework Assignments**: Tasks related to image processing and feature extraction.
2. **Contest Project**: A competitive project conducted at the end of the semester.
3. **Article Presentation**: A detailed analysis and presentation of a relevant article in biomedical imaging.

## Homework Assignments

The homework assignments provide hands-on experience with various aspects of biomedical imaging and analysis. Here are the details of the assignments:

### Homework 1

1. **Part 1: Feature Extraction and Segmentation**
   - **Objective**: To implement classic feature extraction methods using Python's OpenCV (`cv2`) library.
   - **Task**: Apply these feature extraction methods to images of the retina, focusing on the segmentation of retinal veins.
   - **Implementation**: Train a simple neural network model to perform the segmentation task, leveraging the extracted features.

2. **Part 2: Image Compression with SVD**
   - **Objective**: Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression, demonstrating a fundamental application of matrix factorization in computer vision.
   - **Implementation**: Use SVD to reduce the image size while retaining essential visual features, balancing quality and file size.
